Exploring the Cognitive Control in Young Children who Stutter using Electrophysiological and Behavioral Measures

* This study examines the potential impact of emotional processes on cognitive control in young children who do and do not stutter using cortical and behavioral measures.
*  In this study, preschool-age children performed a child-friendly Go/No-go task with emotion induction while their event related potentials (ERPs) and behavioral performance were recorded.
*  Group based comparisons were conducted for cortical measures and their relation to emotional processes, performance accuracy and stuttering severity were analyzed.
*  Results of this study will advance our understanding of cortical associates of inhibitory control, its relation to emotion and to the onset and development of childhood stuttering.

- **EEG data** from NetStation transformed into a dataframe with individual ERP components using erp.easy package. ERP data was compiled, re-organized, and re-structured with feature engineering. 
- **Behavioral data** from e-prime transformed into a dataframe with individual behavioral measures using data wrangling and extensive feature engineering.
- **Survey data** from RedCap transformed into a dataframe with demographic, stuttering and language related measures using data wrangling.
- Data from these different resources complied together into a single daatset.
