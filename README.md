Exploring the Cognitive Control in Young Children who Stutter using Electrophysiological and Behavioral Measures

This study examines the potential impact of emotional processes on cognitive control in young children who do and do not stutter using cortical and behavioral measures. In this study, preschool-age children performed a child-friendly Go/No-go task with emotion induction while their event related potentials (ERPs) and behavioral performance were recorded. Group based comparisons were conducted for cortical measures and their relation to emotional processes, performance accuracy and stuttering severity were analyzed. Results of this study will advance our understanding of cortical associates of inhibitory control, its relation to emotion and to the onset and development of childhood stuttering.
